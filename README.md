# General-CPP
Some basic knowledges and applications of C++ will be delivered. The content focuses on the realization of the function rather than algorithms. In engineering area, the most important thing is to meet various of requirements. No one cares how this is achieved.  
*Anything is at all better than nothing.*

The lecture is devided into 5 parts:
* Variable
* Branch Statement
* Function
* Class
* Operators Overload

After that a comprehensive project will be completed.
